# **App Name**: ResumeAI Rate

## Core Features:

- Landing Page Structure: Design a clear and concise landing page with a hero section, how-it-works, benefits, testimonials, FAQ, and a final CTA section. Include a language toggle for Arabic and English.
- AI Resume Analysis: Integrate the 'Rate Your Resume' AI tool. Users upload their resume, and the tool provides a score based on Tailoring, Content, Format, Sections, and Style, offering instant improvement suggestions. The tool will use Saudi-specific labor laws and cultural norms as a tool when analyzing the resume.
